HeyðŸ‘‹, my name is Juexiao Zhang.

I am currently a 2nd year PhD student at [NYU Courant CS](https://cs.nyu.edu/home/index.html) working with Professor Chen Feng at [AI4CE](https://ai4ce.github.io/#about) Lab.

Nice to meet you!

ðŸ¤” I am excited about teaching the knowledge of the world to our robots and future embodied AI agents.
